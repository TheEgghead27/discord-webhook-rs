# Contributing
This is a simple personal project I wrote to learn Rust, so not everything will be written in the most efficient or standard way, and I make no guarantees that I can respond to issues or merge contributions.

Feel free to fork and edit this project according to the license, and if you feel that your changes improve the program, feel free to file a PR, but I can't promise anything (life gets busy...).
